# Image Sequence Scroll Animation

This project demonstrates a simple image sequence animation controlled by the user's scroll behavior. The image sequence consists of 20 frames and resets to the first frame after reaching the last frame, creating a continuous loop.

# Versions

- **index.html**: The latest version of the project that showcases the scroll-controlled image sequence animation as well as using vertical and horizontal scrolling using GSAP and hotspots and Morph edge.
- **greensock1.html**: An iteration of the base project with enhanced GSAP animations, including smoother transitions and added features like easing effects.
- **greensock2.html**: A further refined version that integrates additional GSAP plugins, offering more complex animations and improved performance.
- **looping-bgimages.html**: A variation that introduces looping background images to complement the image sequence, creating a more immersive visual experience.
- **oldlooping.html**: An earlier approach to looping animations, focusing on a different method of continuous looping before the current technique was implemented.


## Features

- **Scroll-Controlled Animation:** The animation plays forward as the user scrolls down and backward when scrolling up.
- **Frame Reset:** The animation resets to the first frame (`00`) after reaching the last frame (`19`), allowing for continuous scrolling.
- **Centered Image:** The image is centered on the screen and adjusts its size according to the specified height.
