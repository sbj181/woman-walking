# Image Sequence Scroll Animation

This project demonstrates a simple image sequence animation controlled by the user's scroll behavior. The image sequence consists of 20 frames and resets to the first frame after reaching the last frame, creating a continuous loop.

## Features

- **Scroll-Controlled Animation:** The animation plays forward as the user scrolls down and backward when scrolling up.
- **Frame Reset:** The animation resets to the first frame (`00`) after reaching the last frame (`19`), allowing for continuous scrolling.
- **Centered Image:** The image is centered on the screen and adjusts its size according to the specified height.
